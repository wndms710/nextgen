# the speed of sound used by the acoustic eigenfunction solver 
# is set based on a priority in the following order:
#   0) if a result file is specified above, the solver will look for a record "sos_avg"
#   1) if "sos_avg" is not available, the solver will attempt to use a temperature record 
#      and set a speed of sound from sos = sqrt( gamma*R_gas*T)
#         -- GAMMA and R_GAS are both parseable parameters
#         -- by default, it will attempt to find a record named "T_avg" to set the temperature
#         -- if USE_INSTANTANEOUS_T is specified, it will instead look for "T"
#            this should always be accessible from a result file from the solver
#   2) if neither of the above records are available, the solver will request the param 
#      CONSTANT_SOS = [speed-of-sound] to gather a speed of sound

# in the following, the speed of sound is set from the instantaneous sos
USE_INSTANTANEOUS_SOS

# in the following, the speed of sound is set from the instantaneous T

# we now will attempt to measure the gain from an impulse response placed in the 
# domain.  a forcing location is required : 
# X_SEED <x0> <y0> <z0>
# it is sometimes convenient to specify a location near the cap face.  the precise 
# location of the forcing is not exactly important so long as the location does not 
# coincide with a node in the pressure eigenfunction.  as the gain is formally infinite
# at the exact frequency of resonance, the modal frequency itself is not affected.  
# however, the seed location may also weakly influence the width of the tail seen in the 
# mode 

X_SEED 0.0 0.2205 2.617532

# the gain response requires a starting frequency, a delta frequency, and an end 
# frequency for the sweep.  these units of the time must be consistent with the 
# length scale embedded in the mesh and the units of the speed of sound.

SWEEP_FREQUENCY START 100.0 DELTA 1.0 END 1000.0 # the following is in Hz

# after the output is captured, the gain curve can be plotted in gnuplot using
